# Getting Started

1. Install Latest Android Studio Ladybug 2024.2.1 RC 1
2. Make sure to have necessary environment (Java SDK, etc...)

# Baseline App

1. App has a basic structure which relies on separation of concerns per area
2. Some basic stuff are done to bootstrap the project
3. Project follows standard Android/Compose idioms without relying on opinionated libraries like circuit for example
4. Feel free to build on top of this or change the structure as you see fit and/or where it makes sense :)

# Notes

We don't expect pixel perfect UI. Though you are welcome to be creative :)
